				<h1>Blockchain3D</h1>
				<p>With the ongoing hype surrounding crytpocurrencies, many investors and entrepreneurs are curious and sometimes entering the market without a full set of necessary information to make the best decisions. Not much interest has been directed towards what exactly blockchain technology is and how powerful it can be when applied properly.

With blockchain technology's ability to achieve remote and autonomous consensus between users, businesses have quickly figured out that such self-reliant data infrastructure is useful far beyond the well-known cryptocurrency applications. Blockchain can help bring products and transactional services to market quickly and inexpensively, offload the traditionally high costs of security, implement Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols, reduce the costs of data storage and a host of other overheads. By reducing costs and increasing efficiency, it allows businesses of all sizes to compete on an increasingly level playing field.

Blockchain3D is a group tailored to interested minds, business users and experienced professionals in the technology field. Together, we can find real-world applications for blockchain technology in order to take your business, personal life and knowledge to the next level.

IMPORTANT: Blockchain3D is NOT a cryptocurrency interest group. We strive to dig deeper than the surface and find additional applications of blockchain based technologies beyond crytocurrencies. Join our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Blockchain3D/">Meetup</a>.</p>
